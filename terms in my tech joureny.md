Canarying Deployment: is the process of testing a new version of a service in production with a small amount of traffic before rolling out the change to the entire user base. 
This is a best practice for any software release.

Bule Green Deployment: is a deployment strategy that involves running two identical production environments called blue and green. At any time, 
only one of the environments is live, with the live environment serving all production traffic. 
The other environment is used for testing. 
When you are ready to switch to the new environment, you simply redirect traffic from the old environment to the new environment. 
This is a best practice for any software release.

Helm: is a package manager for Kubernetes. Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications â€” 
Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.

Kubernetes: is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

docker: is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

Kubernetes Engine: is a managed, production-ready environment for deploying containerized applications.

cluster: is a set of compute resources that run containerized applications.

node: is a virtual machine (VM) instance that runs containerized applications.

pod: is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage/network, and a specification for how to run the containers.

container: is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

container registry: is a storage and content delivery system, backed by the Cloud Storage, for your Docker images.

3-tier web application: is a web application that is divided into three logical tiers: the presentation tier, the application tier, and the data tier.

microservices: is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, which implement business capabilities.

service: is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.

Heterogeneous deployments are called "hybrid", "multi-cloud", or "public-private", depending upon the specifics of the deployment.

one-off||ad-hoc  deployment is a deployment that is not intended to be permanent.
